A streak of light that shone on despair
The powerful light stole my gaze away
Someday I, myself too, in this galaxy
Will become a powerful, powerful star

Yah yah yah, A straight flash of light
Yah yah yah, A straightforward jealousy
Yah yah yah, A straightforward emotion
Yelled out loud

Right now it is just a Blue Impulse
A resolution that won't be beaten by anyone
And even if this body perishes
A hope that I can't let go

Yah yah yah, A straight flash of light
Yah yah yah, A straightforward jealousy
Yah yah yah, Before long the world will start to move with this
